### Kafka Producer

A producer is the one which publishes or writes data to the topics within different partitions.

Kafka consumers are typically part of a consumer group . When multiple consumers are subscribed to a topic and belong to the same consumer group, each consumer in the group will receive messages from a different subset of the partitions in the topic.
